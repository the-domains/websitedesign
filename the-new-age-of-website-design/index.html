Better ask why do they need one? Nowadays consumers want to check your business first before they consider doing business with you. They want to know more details about your product or service before stepping into your shop or business. A website gives them a sense of control and the assurance to handle with you confidently about what you can provide for them. In this way it also gives them the feeling that they can assess how knowledgeable you are about your product or service.</p><p>What does a website do for your business?</p><p>A website is a cost effective way to promote your business. It saves you money in advertising compared to what you would need to spend on printing, flyers, magazines, radio and TV to reach the same potential market. It reduces the manual labour cost of distribution and works faster at spreading and reaching a wider market. </p><p>What benefits would you get from a website?</p><p>Instead of only being available eight hours a day at the location of your business, you´re available 24/7 answering your prospective client’s questions and showing them the quality of your products or service. All this without having to be physically present at all hours of the day or night. You will have answered your customer´s questions before they even have been asked. This also reduces your time in having to give information and trying to explain things personally, as time is money.</p><p>Where would you use a website.</p><p>Newspapers and magazines can only be spread as far as their distribution list. Flyers are usually restricted to the area where you are allowed to place them. A website is your personal online brochure that you can spread worldwide when promoting it to your acquaintances or linking it to social media sites and search engines. </p><p>With whom would you want to share your website.</p><p>Ofcourse you would want to share your website with as many people as possible. The more you share the more people will see it. Like your friends, their friends, your groups, businesses, the wider audience the better. This can also be done through search engines and various media sites like Facebook, YouTube, Google+, Twitter, Forums, etc.</p><p>When would be the best use for your website.</p><p>The minute you start a business, have a hobby, look for a job, or share an interest, so you can attract traffic and revenue. In this way you can keep your customers or viewers up-to-date instead of having to tell each visitor on an individual basis. You can showcase your services or products to a wide range of similar interested people. And by providing information and tips, you show your knowledge and experience within this area.</p><p>How would your website be beneficial to you?</p><p>In previous generations for people to find you they just had to look in a telephone book or the yellow pages. In this generation people check the internet to get in contact with you. If your website gives a clear and concise message, answers people´s questions in advance and is user friendly, then potential clients prefer dealing with you instead of your competitors.
